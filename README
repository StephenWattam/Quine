This program outputs its own source code to a file, 'Quine.java'.  Run the 
class to get the code, compile the code to get the class.  Simple.

Info on Quines here:

T'was written on java 1.5, in first year.  I also made a few versions that would
recompile themselves and run themselves again, but that got a bit insane.
